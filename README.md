# Ridge Regression Implementation in Python

The python code contains an implementation of ridge regression (l2 regularized regression) contrasted with ordinary least squares regression.

## Components

* RidgeRegression - Performs the l2 regularized regression on the data and returns the coefficient vector wRR and the degree of freedom vector df
* calcRMSE - Calculates and plots the RMSE for different values of the regularization parameter lambda and passed polynomial degree
* PolyOrderInput - Calculates the polynomial inputs data based on passed parameter
